One notable feature is the ability to dynamically add projects to the projects section and jobs to the resume section, without having to copy and paste code. In order to change one of those things, all you need to do is modify the Javascript file in the repo `page_data.js`. This makes it much less tedious to add things prone to duplicate code, such as projects in a grid.",
